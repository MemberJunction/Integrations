## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 517466f: Fix silent record loss in NetForum + ORCID pagination, and declare the missing `connector-schema-merge` runtime dependency in HubSpot + Totara.

  **NetForum**: `FetchChanges` requested `@TOP -1` (the entire result set in one SOAP call) and hardcoded `HasMore: false`, so `BatchSize` was ignored and the computed `NextAfterKeyValue` was discarded. Now issues a `@TOP <BatchSize>` window with an `ORDER BY` on the stable ordering key, applies a `> AfterKeyValue` keyset predicate on resume, and reports `HasMore` from the page fill. Objects with no ordering key can't be paged safely, so they keep the single-call behavior and now emit an `UNPAGINATED_FETCH` warning instead of failing silently. `NewWatermarkValue` advances only on the final page.

  **ORCID**: `ResolveOrcidIdUniverse` sliced the resolved iD universe to `BatchSize` and returned `HasMore: false` — every iD past the first page was permanently discarded on every sync. The universe is now returned whole and sorted, windowed by `AfterKeyValue`, with `HasMore` + `NextAfterKeyValue` set so the scan completes across pages. Watermark advances only on the last page.

  **HubSpot / Totara**: both `import` `@memberjunction/connector-schema-merge` at runtime but declared it under `devDependencies`, which does not ship to consumers — the same `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` shape that leaves HubSpot broken on npm at 1.1.1. Moved to `dependencies`.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- dbffddf: Declare semantic lengths for url/email-class string fields (255 default → url 2048, email 320). Oversize values are skipped, not truncated — silent record-loss risk.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- cc38129: Widen prose string fields (description/notes/bio/summary/…) from the 255 default to 4000. The engine skips-not-truncates oversize values, so every such field was a silent record-skip risk — live repro: PheedLoop Members.about skipped 54 records/sync at 255 vs real 2,595-char values.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fe75578: Fix the PostgreSQL seed migration so `mj app install` succeeds on PostgreSQL.

  The 1.0.0 PostgreSQL migration (`migrations-pg/*.pg.sql`) was generated with a stale SS→PG converter (CLI 5.36, which predates the boolean SP-argument coercion shipped in 5.40.x). It emitted the integration-catalog `spCreate*` calls with integer `_Clear` flags (`p_<col>_Clear := 1`) against `BOOLEAN` parameters. Because PostgreSQL resolves function overloads by exact argument type and has no implicit `integer → boolean` cast for a named argument, every such call aborted on apply with:

  ```
  ERROR: function __mj.spCreateIntegrationObject(... p_<col>_clear => integer ...) does not exist
  ```

  Regenerated each `.pg.sql` with CLI 5.43.0, which emits native `:= TRUE`/`:= FALSE`. The same regeneration also corrects a second 5.36 defect: identifier-quoting (`."Configuration"`) leaking into string literals inside seeded descriptions and `Configuration` JSON.

  SQL Server migrations (`migrations/*.sql`) are unchanged — this is a PostgreSQL-only fix.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 50cb849: Initial release: self-contained Open App shipping its Integration metadata (objects + fields) and credential type. Strict-TypeScript build clean.
