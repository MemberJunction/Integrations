## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fe75578: Fix the PostgreSQL seed migration so `mj app install` succeeds on PostgreSQL.

  The 1.0.0 PostgreSQL migration (`migrations-pg/*.pg.sql`) was generated with a stale SS→PG converter (CLI 5.36, which predates the boolean SP-argument coercion shipped in 5.40.x). It emitted the integration-catalog `spCreate*` calls with integer `_Clear` flags (`p_<col>_Clear := 1`) against `BOOLEAN` parameters. Because PostgreSQL resolves function overloads by exact argument type and has no implicit `integer → boolean` cast for a named argument, every such call aborted on apply with:

  ```
  ERROR: function __mj.spCreateIntegrationObject(... p_<col>_clear => integer ...) does not exist
  ```

  Regenerated each `.pg.sql` with CLI 5.43.0, which emits native `:= TRUE`/`:= FALSE`. The same regeneration also corrects a second 5.36 defect: identifier-quoting (`."Configuration"`) leaking into string literals inside seeded descriptions and `Configuration` JSON.

  SQL Server migrations (`migrations/*.sql`) are unchanged — this is a PostgreSQL-only fix.
