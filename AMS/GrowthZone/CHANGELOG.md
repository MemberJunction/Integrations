## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 197c567: Mark MembershipStatusLookup and MembershipChange as detail-only (listSupported:false, with gap notes). Both are structurally unlistable — {defaultMembershipStatus} is a configured value and {changeType} is an enum with no parent object; two vars behind a single parentObjectName trip the engine's PARENT_CYCLE guard. They previously sat Active while silently fetching zero records.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 991a336: Fix the seed migration so `mj app install` succeeds — the migration now creates the connector's CredentialType **before** the Integration.

  These connectors define their own `MJ: Credential Types` row (e.g. `PropFuel API`, `GrowthZone OAuth2`, `Salesforce JWT Bearer`) and their `Integration` row references it via `CredentialTypeID`. The published migration seeded the `Integration` but **never created the CredentialType**, so every fresh install aborted at the migration step (which runs before any metadata sync) with:

  ```
  The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK_Integration_CredentialType" (SQL Server)
  function __mj.spCreateIntegration(...) — FK_Integration_CredentialType (PostgreSQL)
  ```

  Root cause was in the seed-migration generator: it reset the `Integration`/`IntegrationObject`/`IntegrationObjectField` catalog between connectors but **left CredentialType rows in the generation DB**, so `mj sync push`'s SQL-logging saw the type already present and emitted no `spCreateCredentialType` call. Fixed the generator to also delete each connector's own CredentialType before its push, so the create is re-emitted; the existing `directoryOrder` (credential-type before integration) places it ahead of the Integration in the migration.

  Verified: each connector's regenerated migration applies cleanly against a real `__mj` schema (real `FK_Integration_CredentialType` + `spCreate*` functions) — CredentialType created, then Integration, then objects, 0 errors. Both SQL Server and PostgreSQL migrations regenerated; same migration version (in place).

  Connectors that reference a **core** credential type (`OAuth2 Client Credentials`, `Azure Service Principal`, `API Key`, `OAuth2 Password Grant`) are unaffected and unchanged — those types exist on every fresh instance.

  The `spCreateCredentialType` call is also guarded with `IF NOT EXISTS` (both dialects), so installing two connectors that share a credential type (Fonteva and Salesforce both use `Salesforce JWT Bearer`) on the same instance no longer collides — the second install skips the already-created type. Verified: Salesforce-then-Fonteva on one instance, both Integrations created, 0 errors.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fe75578: Fix the PostgreSQL seed migration so `mj app install` succeeds on PostgreSQL.

  The 1.0.0 PostgreSQL migration (`migrations-pg/*.pg.sql`) was generated with a stale SS→PG converter (CLI 5.36, which predates the boolean SP-argument coercion shipped in 5.40.x). It emitted the integration-catalog `spCreate*` calls with integer `_Clear` flags (`p_<col>_Clear := 1`) against `BOOLEAN` parameters. Because PostgreSQL resolves function overloads by exact argument type and has no implicit `integer → boolean` cast for a named argument, every such call aborted on apply with:

  ```
  ERROR: function __mj.spCreateIntegrationObject(... p_<col>_clear => integer ...) does not exist
  ```

  Regenerated each `.pg.sql` with CLI 5.43.0, which emits native `:= TRUE`/`:= FALSE`. The same regeneration also corrects a second 5.36 defect: identifier-quoting (`."Configuration"`) leaking into string literals inside seeded descriptions and `Configuration` JSON.

  SQL Server migrations (`migrations/*.sql`) are unchanged — this is a PostgreSQL-only fix.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 50cb849: Initial release: self-contained Open App shipping its Integration metadata (objects + fields) and credential type. Strict-TypeScript build clean.
