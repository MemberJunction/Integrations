# @memberjunction/connector-path-lms

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 06b2b4b: Allow MemberJunction 6.x as a peer. Every connector capped its `@memberjunction/*` peers at `<6.0.0`; the ceiling moves to `<7.0.0`, and `mj-app.json.mjVersionRange` moves with it so npm and `mjdev app register` agree. Floors are unchanged, so 5.x hosts are unaffected.

  Why the ceiling is the fix on a 6.x host: pnpm's `auto-install-peers` satisfies an unmet peer range by installing a **second** copy of `@memberjunction/core`, and two copies of core in one process is the failure that surfaces as thousands of unrelated-looking type errors. Business Central hit exactly this and was widened alone (#180, then #208 for the manifest); this brings the other 56 connectors, the two private platform packages, and the shared `connector-id-window-scan` package to the same range, so the duplicate cannot return transitively through a shared dependency either. The scaffolding scripts (`new-connector`, `scaffold-openapps`, `split-into-packages`) now mint `<7.0.0` too, so a new connector does not reintroduce the cap.

  Verified at compile time, not at runtime: all 61 packages in the repo (57 connectors, the two private platform packages, the two shared packages) type-check against `@memberjunction/*@6.1.0-edge.5` — the only 6.x published at the time; there is no stable 6.x yet — with every framework `.d.ts` resolved from the 6.x install and none from 5.x. That check is `npm run check:mj-compat` (`scripts/typecheck-against-mj.mjs`), added with this change so the claim can be re-run against any MJ version. It is API compatibility at the type level; the only runtime evidence on a 6.x host remains the Business Central team's edge deployment.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 6ee916d: Relicense to the Business Source License 1.1.

  Metadata and documentation only: the `license` field moves to `BUSL-1.1` and the
  repo gains a LICENSE file. No runtime behaviour, API surface, or dependency
  changes. The bump exists so the new licence metadata reaches npm, since the
  registry shows the licence of the latest published version.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 37cfe35: Sample-union discovery for describe-endpoint connectors: each connector wires MJ's existing `DiscoverFieldsViaFetch` sampler into its declared catalog inside `IntrospectSchema`, unioned per object via the shared pure helper `mergeDeclaredWithSampledFields` — real widths and MJ-discovered custom columns land before the first sync (no `nvarchar(255)` overflow / `STRING_OVERFLOW_SKIPPED`). Connectors with no `IntrospectSchema` of their own get the standard `super.IntrospectSchema → sample → merge → return` override; connectors that already own an `IntrospectSchema` (HubSpot, Salesforce, Nimble AMS, YourMembership) are WRAPPED — their existing logic/caching is preserved and the union runs on the built result before return (Fonteva inherits it via Salesforce's `super`).

  The width rule is NEVER-SHRINK: `MaxLength = max(declared, measured)`. It only ever widens, so connectors that already carry real declared widths from their describe API (Salesforce/Fonteva) are never truncated below the real width, while connectors whose declared catalog has no width still adopt MJ's measured value. Connectors add no discovery/merge/sync logic of their own; MJ owns measurement, type/PK inference, persistence and reconcile. `DiscoverFields` is unchanged (no recursion). Schema-less / already-streaming connectors (PropFuel, FileFeed, RelationalDB, MJtoMJ, ORCID) are unaffected.

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- dbffddf: Declare semantic lengths for url/email-class string fields (255 default → url 2048, email 320). Oversize values are skipped, not truncated — silent record-loss risk.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- cc38129: Widen prose string fields (description/notes/bio/summary/…) from the 255 default to 4000. The engine skips-not-truncates oversize values, so every such field was a silent record-skip risk — live repro: PheedLoop Members.about skipped 54 records/sync at 255 vs real 2,595-char values.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 991a336: Fix the seed migration so `mj app install` succeeds — the migration now creates the connector's CredentialType **before** the Integration.

  These connectors define their own `MJ: Credential Types` row (e.g. `PropFuel API`, `GrowthZone OAuth2`, `Salesforce JWT Bearer`) and their `Integration` row references it via `CredentialTypeID`. The published migration seeded the `Integration` but **never created the CredentialType**, so every fresh install aborted at the migration step (which runs before any metadata sync) with:

  ```
  The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK_Integration_CredentialType" (SQL Server)
  function __mj.spCreateIntegration(...) — FK_Integration_CredentialType (PostgreSQL)
  ```

  Root cause was in the seed-migration generator: it reset the `Integration`/`IntegrationObject`/`IntegrationObjectField` catalog between connectors but **left CredentialType rows in the generation DB**, so `mj sync push`'s SQL-logging saw the type already present and emitted no `spCreateCredentialType` call. Fixed the generator to also delete each connector's own CredentialType before its push, so the create is re-emitted; the existing `directoryOrder` (credential-type before integration) places it ahead of the Integration in the migration.

  Verified: each connector's regenerated migration applies cleanly against a real `__mj` schema (real `FK_Integration_CredentialType` + `spCreate*` functions) — CredentialType created, then Integration, then objects, 0 errors. Both SQL Server and PostgreSQL migrations regenerated; same migration version (in place).

  Connectors that reference a **core** credential type (`OAuth2 Client Credentials`, `Azure Service Principal`, `API Key`, `OAuth2 Password Grant`) are unaffected and unchanged — those types exist on every fresh instance.

  The `spCreateCredentialType` call is also guarded with `IF NOT EXISTS` (both dialects), so installing two connectors that share a credential type (Fonteva and Salesforce both use `Salesforce JWT Bearer`) on the same instance no longer collides — the second install skips the already-created type. Verified: Salesforce-then-Fonteva on one instance, both Integrations created, 0 errors.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fe75578: Fix the PostgreSQL seed migration so `mj app install` succeeds on PostgreSQL.

  The 1.0.0 PostgreSQL migration (`migrations-pg/*.pg.sql`) was generated with a stale SS→PG converter (CLI 5.36, which predates the boolean SP-argument coercion shipped in 5.40.x). It emitted the integration-catalog `spCreate*` calls with integer `_Clear` flags (`p_<col>_Clear := 1`) against `BOOLEAN` parameters. Because PostgreSQL resolves function overloads by exact argument type and has no implicit `integer → boolean` cast for a named argument, every such call aborted on apply with:

  ```
  ERROR: function __mj.spCreateIntegrationObject(... p_<col>_clear => integer ...) does not exist
  ```

  Regenerated each `.pg.sql` with CLI 5.43.0, which emits native `:= TRUE`/`:= FALSE`. The same regeneration also corrects a second 5.36 defect: identifier-quoting (`."Configuration"`) leaking into string literals inside seeded descriptions and `Configuration` JSON.

  SQL Server migrations (`migrations/*.sql`) are unchanged — this is a PostgreSQL-only fix.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 50cb849: Initial release: self-contained Open App shipping its Integration metadata (objects + fields) and credential type. Strict-TypeScript build clean.
